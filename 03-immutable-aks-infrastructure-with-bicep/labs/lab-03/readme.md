# lab-03 - Outputs

## Estimated completion time - 15 min

There are (at least) two use-cases where Bicep `outputs` can be useful:

* You can use `outputs` to return values from the template. You might need to capture properties from a newly created resource so they're available later for reference. For example, it might be helpful to get the endpoints for your new storage account, or to get subnet id and use it later as a reference at AKS cluster template. This is especially useful when you group your resources using `Modules`.
* You can use `outputs` to debug your Bicep template.

## Goals

In this lab you will learn:

* How to debug your Bicep template using `outputs`
* How to return resource resource properties as Bicep `outputs`

## Task #1 - trace variables values as template outputs

Let's keep working with Bicep file from [lab-02](../lab-02/readme.md). If you didn't manage to finish it, use [infra.bicep](../../completed-labs/lab-02/infra.bicep) file from the completed labs folder.

Let's imagine that we want to trace the value of `vnetName` and `vnetAddressPrefix` variables to verify if we implemented these values correctly in our template. To do so, add two new `outputs` to the end of the file like this:

```yaml
...
output aksSubnetAddressPrefix string = aksSubnetAddressPrefix
output vnetName string = vnetName
```

> Note, that you need to specify the type of the output parameter.

```bash
# Deploy Bicep template
az deployment group create -g iac-dev-blue-rg -f ./infra.bicep -p dev-blue.json
```

Check the `outputs` section of the script output. You should see something similar to: 

```json
...
"outputs": {
  "aksSubnetAddressPrefix": {
    "type": "String",
    "value": "10.10.0.0/20"
  },
  "vnetName": {
    "type": "String",
    "value": "iac-dev-blue-vnet"
  }
},
...
```

You can always find ARM or Bicep templates output at the Azure portal. Navigate to the `Deployments` tab of the `iac-dev-blue-rg` resource group, open `infra` deployment and go to `Output` section.

Alternatively, you can get deployment information using `az cli`

```bash
# Get deployment info
az deployment group show -g iac-dev-blue-rg -n infra
```

The you can analyse the `outputs` section to check the output values.

## Task #2 - use output to return subnet id

Quite often you need to use one resource id as a reference inside other resource template. For instance, when you deploy your AKS cluster into your own VNet, you need to provide subnet id as a reference. Let's expose `aks` subnet id as an Bicep `output`.

In our Bicep template `aks` subnet is implemented as an individual child resource called `aksSubnet` type of `subnets`. [subnets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.network/virtualnetworks/subnets?tabs=bicep&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003837) is a Bicep resource, containing several properties, including `id`. 

To expose `aks` subnet id, add the following code to the end of the Bicep file:

```yaml
output aksSubnetId string = aksSubnet.id
```

> Note, if you use Bicep plugin, you will get intellisense showing you all available properties of the object.

![bicep-plugin](images/bicep-plugin.png)


```bash
# Deploy Bicep template
az deployment group create -g iac-dev-blue-rg -f ./infra.bicep -p dev-blue.json
```

and check the `outputs` section of the script output. You should now see new output item called `aksSubnetId`:

```json
...
"outputs": {
...    
    "aksSubnetId": {
      "type": "String",
      "value": "/subscriptions/8878beb2-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-783674eea324/resourceGroups/iac-dev-blue-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/iac-dev-blue-vnet/subnets/aks"   
      },
...      
}
...
```
