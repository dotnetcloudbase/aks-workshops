# lab-01 - provision workshop resources 

## Estimated completion time - 20 min

As always, to start working with labs, we need to provision Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instance. For this workshop we will use [Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003837). AKS and supporting resources are not free and the compute power will come with some costs, but we will use the smallest Virtual Machine size for our nodes and we will use just a few nodes when we will work with cluster autoscaling. Also, remember to delete all resources when you are finished working with the labs. Here is the list of resources we need to provision:

* Resource Group
* Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Azure Log Analytics
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Our AKS cluster will fullfil the following requirements:

* Use [managed identities in AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-managed-identity?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003837) to create additional resources like load balancers and managed disks in Azure
* Integrate AKS with Azure Log Analytics for monitoring
* Integrate AKS with Azure Container Registry

Here is the complete visualization of resources we will provision.

## Goals

* Provision workshop resources

## Task #1 - deploy workshop resources

All `Bicep` templates are located under `infra` folder and are split into the following modules: 

| Module name | Description |
|--|--|
| acr.bicep | Azure Container Registry resource implementation |
| vnet.bicep | Private Virtual Network implementation |
| logAnalytics.bicep | Log Analytics implementation |
| aks.bicep | AKS implementation |
| attachACRToAKS.bicep | Contains code that attaches ACR to AKS instance |
| grantAksPermissions.bicep | Contains code that assign Network Contributor Role to AKS principal id |

Deployment is orchestrated by the `deployment.bicep` template. All parameters are extracted into `parameters-blue.json` file. 

Let's provision `blue` cluster first.

```bash
# Select your subscription
az account set --subscription <YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID>

# Deploy workshop resources
az deployment sub create --location westeurope --template-file ./deployment.bicep  --parameters './parameters.json'
 \ Running ..

# When provisioned (it takes approx. 5 min), connect to your cluster
az aks get-credentials --resource-group iac-ws5-rg --name iac-ws5-aks --overwrite-existing

# Install kubectl
az aks install-cli
```

If you use PowerShell, you need to update system PATH environment variable and add new item for `%userprofile%\.azure-kubectl`. 

![env](images/env.png)

* Open the Start Search, type in `env`, and choose `Edit the system environment variables`
* Click the `Environment Variablesâ€¦` button.
* Select `Path` variable under `System variables` section
* CLick `Edit...`
* Click `New` and set variable to `%userprofile%\.azure-kubectl`

You need to reset your PowerShell (and cmd) session(s) for change to take effect.

If you are running on WSL, you may need to use `sudo` command, in this case run 

```bash
# Install kubectl using sudo
sudo az aks install-cli
```

When `kubectl` is installed, test it by getting list of namespaces...

```bash
# Get list of namespaces
kubectl get ns
NAME              STATUS   AGE
calico-system     Active   3m51s
default           Active   6m21s
kube-node-lease   Active   6m24s
kube-public       Active   6m24s
kube-system       Active   6m24s
tigera-operator   Active   6m
```

If you use [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/), you can configure that the name of active cluster is shown at the command line prompt, as it's shown below:
